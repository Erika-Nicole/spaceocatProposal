# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

0:01 Demo 
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Explore an analog horror game that has some ascepts of searching through an arg website made by me. The game is short, something that has the feels of Silent Hill, Marble Hornets, and the Slenderverse.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will introduce the player to a strange environment where people have slowly start to go missing and be replaced by copycat versions of themselves to fool the public. The website will detail a lot of the events within the story for the game, and the game itself will be in the lens of a young woman (Marisol Perez) who explores the small town and a small introduction to the demo planning of an objective. (This will later be found out what it'll be on.)

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A I believe.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Make the website with the ARG aspect in mind. The game might be unpolished and possibly not work, but if the ARG works with the things that suits the game itself, then I guess that's a good outcome.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The ARG and the game actually functions but there's some things that could be better. The ARG and the game might be missing things, like as connections to each other, the coding isn't debugged properly and the assests are not complete for the game. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Everything is great, the world spins. The demo actually work with the assests in mind. And the arg is awesome!!

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

A lot of drawing my own assest. Researching on how to make a game on the Godot engine and how to function with an arg website.
