# Final Thoughts on the Project

Although terrible at saying it through a recording, I believe this project was a great way to explore the different things publicly available through the web and through my own learning. I've learned C before
at Temple University, and dividing into CSharp was somewhat similar. It begs the question on why I don't try learning a few more and being able to make this game more better and polished. But I think
that's the niche to this project, it didn't have to be perfect. 

I followed so many tutorials, I had to stand up and walk away from my computer, I had to still do so much work from other classes too and this all in one month seems easy for any expert in Unity or in coding.
However, I never gave in! I wished I got to make the game how I envisioned, and maybe I can, just after the semester is over and I'm able to pick up my side hobbies once more. 

**What was something you could improve on?**

I would've definitely stuck my nose into the text books (or online) to see how Blender, Unity, and CSharp tends to work. If I hadn't goofed around, maybe I could've gotten to that. I relied on the tutorials
*because* I tried to do it on my own. First try, then see the code that is correct. If it isn't? Do it all over again till it works. I liked that even the video tutorial I had went through was a learning
experience for both me and the instructor.

**What was something you enjoyed doing?**

When the Code finally worked at 3 am and I'm celebrating (only to be told to shush.) I think that was such a great feeling to have, and really, I think some people in the class had that same feeling, too. 
It was hard trying to grasp another coding language in 1 month (less for me since I had to juggle with this and my other classes.) It was a relief seeing the code script worked, only to find something else didn't.

The other thing was getting the grasp on how Unity worked. Blender not so much, but Unity was used for the majority of the time. I tried to learn a few new tricks with it, got humbled a few times, and almost switched
to Unreal. Guess I just locked in!

**What was something you hated?**

I think when it came to putting the enemy entity in, that was the one thing that took so long for me to script (just for it not to work and for me not being able to showcase it in my game.) I wanted the enemy to have
a small delay before going in and attacking the player. While that was happening, you could interact with the cats in the game and or try to find the key. (Also, side note, the model was suppose to be Slender
Man but I tried on Blender. I think Blender is good for me for now.)

**Will I do this again?**

I would definitely do this again even if I rip all my hair off. It was a challenge, not everything I followed in the tutorial worked, I had to scan for other ways to ensure the vision I had for the game worked. 
It was a good first try, but possibly not the last. 

Overall, I had fun doing this! It was stressful and it challenged me greatly. But it was something that got me moving and learning.
